André writes and operates software for a living. He has experience with high availability software development, observability and cloud computing.

As a developer he found it difficult and curious to monitor applications, that's when he started to study platforms for monitoring distributed systems. This made him learn more about Cloud Computing, Operating Systems, Continuos Integration and Delivery. Today his work is dedicated to making software engineers have an easier life with more reliable systems.

He lives in a town in southern Brazil. He loves traveling to experience different places and cultures. In his free time he enjoys playing padel tennis and mountain biking.
