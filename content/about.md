André develops and operates software for a living, with experience in high-availability systems, observability, and cloud computing.

As a developer, he found monitoring applications both challenging and intriguing, which led him to explore platforms for distributed system observability. This journey deepened his knowledge of cloud computing, operating systems, and continuous integration/delivery. Today, his work focuses on helping software engineers build more reliable systems with ease.

He lives in southern Brazil and enjoys traveling to experience new places and cultures. In his free time, he plays padel tennis and goes mountain biking.
