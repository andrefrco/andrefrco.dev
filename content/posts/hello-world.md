Hey, guys.

I hope this is my first post of many. If anyone learns new things here I'll be very happy :smiley:

In this space I will share topics related to software and reliability engineering. Maybe there will be a little focus on Observability, an area I work in today and really enjoy.

For some time now I have been wanting to give back to the community for the teachings I received. There are several ways to do this, but I decided to create a blog for the following reasons:
- Use posts as a record of the projects I study and work on;
- Improve my documentation and writing skills in English;
- Talk to colleagues about the subject and perhaps make new friends;
- Learn the use of new tools and technologies.

Feel free to correct me at any time or get in touch to share thoughts.
